    <h1>Solving The 3x3</h1>
    <div class="first">
      <h2>The First Side</h2>
      <p>
        The overall idea when solving the original Rubik’s Cube (3x3) is to
        solve it layer by layer. We start by solving one side (or layer) of the
        cube. We then move towards solving the middle layer, and finish with
        solving the top layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        To start, we will be solving the white side of the cube. To solve the
        first side of any cube, there are no real algorithms. It may be
        difficult to understand the movements needed, but with enough practice,
        everyone can solve the initial layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, there are no algorithms for the first layer, but these tips can
        help.
      </p>
      <h4>Getting the Initial Cross</h4>

      <img
        src="/projectimages/white-cross.jpg"
        alt="White Cross"
        title="White Cross"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Initial Cross</p>
      <p>
        As seen in the picture, solving the first layer is a lot easier once you
        get the initial cross done. For this first step, you should be focusing
        on finding the white edges, and matching their opposing colors to the
        center pieces of the cube. The blue and white edge should be lined up
        with the blue and white center pieces, and the red and white edges
        should match the red and white centers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we need to plug in the corners. For example, the white, green and
        red corner has to line up with the white, green and red center and edge
        pieces

      </div>
      <p>
        Again, with no algorithms it can be hard to solve the initial layer.
        Through logic and practice, you’ll soon find that solving one side is
        easier than it looks!
      </p>

      />
      <p class="caption">Completed White Side</p>
    </div>
    <div class="middle">
      <h2>The Middle Layer</h2>
      <p>
        After solving one layer, we have to move on to the middle layer. Within
        this layer, you will be placing edges in the proper spaces in order to
        get both the initial and middle layer to be matched up and completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This layer follows one algorithm, but you will need to position the
        edges in the correct place before using the algorithm.
      </p>

      <img
        src="/projectimages/middle-edge-right.jpg"
        alt="Edge-Right"
        title="Edge-Right"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Red and Blue Edge: Right</p>
      <p>
        Looking at the picture above, we will be using the blue and red edge for
        our example. This edge piece needs to move into the middle slot, between
        the blue and red center pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before getting into the algorithm, our blue and red edge needs to be
        positioned as shown in the picture, with the blue side of the edge
        lining up with the blue center piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now since the red side is to the right of the blue side, and the blue
        and red edge piece, we will use the Middle Right algorithm:
      </p>
      <p class="algo">Middle Right Algorithm: U, R, U’, R’, U’ F’, U, F</p>
      <p>
        After using this algorithm, your piece should be correctly placed, as
        shown in the picture below
      </p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/middle-edge-placed.jpg"
        alt="Edge-placed"
        title="Edge-placed"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Middle Edge Alignment</p>
      <p>
        Edge pieces in the middle layer will either have to be moved to the
        right (as shown above), or to the left. When moving an edge piece to the
        left, we will be using the Middle Left algorithm. You should note that
        this algorithm is the exact same as the Middle Right algorithm you’ve
        already used, but just flipped.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/middle-edge-left.jpg"
        alt="Edge-left"
        title="Edge-left"

      <p class="caption">Orange and Green Edge: Left</p>
      <p class="algo">Middle Left Algorithm: U’, L’, U, L, U, F, U’, F’</p>
      <p>
        These two algorithms should be repeated for all middle edge pieces,
        until the middle layer and first layer are aligned and solved!
      </p>

        src="/projectimages/middle-layer.jpg"

    </div>
    <div class="final">
      <h2>The Final Layer</h2>
      <p>
        Our next algorithms are all aimed towards solving the yellow, or top,
        side of the cube. There are only two algorithms to get the top layer,
        but it is important to pay attention to positioning while solving this
        section. Additionally, the two algorithms will be repeated multiple
        times throughout this step.
      </p>
      <h4>Getting A Yellow Cross</h4>
      <p>
        After solving the middle layer, the top layer pieces can take many
        different shapes. During some solves, you may have a yellow cross right
        after completing the middle layer. However, there is a good chance that
        your yellow cross is not yet formed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not have a yellow cross, you will have one of the three
        following scenarios:
      </p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/yellow-center.jpg"
        alt="y-dot"
        title="y-dot"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Yellow Center Piece (Top Layer)</p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/yellow-line.jpg"
        alt="y-line"
        title="y-line"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Yellow Line Across (Top Layer)</p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/yellow-L.jpg"
        alt="y-l"
        title="y-l"
        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Yellow ‘L’ (Top Layer)</p>
      <p>
        For all of these situations, the algorithm remains the same. However,
        the positioning of the cube is crucial. The pictures above capture the
        top layer, and how each situation should be positioned if this was your
        face.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the yellow side has to remain on the top throughout these final
        steps. This means that the face of your cube should be blue, red, green,
        or orange. The white and initial layer should remain on the bottom,
        while the yellow layer remains on the top.
      </p>
      <p>Once positioned correctly, the algorithm is:</p>
      <p class="algo">Yellow ‘L’ Algorithm: F, U, R, U’, R’, F’</p>
      <h4>After The Cross</h4>
      <p>
        After getting the yellow cross, you may notice that there are many
        different variations of what surrounds the core cross. In order to solve
        the yellow side, you must repeat a simple algorithm (shown below), but
        also must position the cube in the correct positions before doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following pictures show the different scenarios. As with the
        previous section, these pictures show how the top layer is positioned;
        the face of your cube should still be blue, red, green, or orange.
      </p>

      <p class="algo">
        Yellow Cross Scenarios Algorithm: R, U, R’, U, R, U, U, R’
      </p>
      <p>
        This algorithm will have to be repeated until the yellow side is
        completed. Each time you do the algorithm, you will get one of the
        shapes shown above. Remember to position these shapes correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have fish, you will only have to complete the algorithm 1-2
        more times, before solving the yellow side.
      </p>
      <h4>Setting Up the Final Steps</h4>
      <p>
        After completing the top, yellow side, you will notice that the edges
        and corners of the yellow layer are still not aligned. Our next step is
        to align these pieces, and complete the cube.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing the top, yellow side, you first line up the corners. If
        two corners are already correctly placed, you have to position them to
        align with their center color, as shown below.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/yellow-two-corners.jpg"

      <p class="caption">
        In This Example, The Blue Side Should Be Placed As The Back Side Of Your

      <p class="algo">Run To Me Algorithm: R’, F, R’, B2, R, F’, R’, B2, R2</p>
      <p>
        If no corners were correctly positioned after completing the top, yellow
        side, still perform the above algorithm, however the positioning is
        inconsequential.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Steps</h4>
      <p>
        Our final step is to correct the positioning of the yellow edge pieces.
      </p>
      <img
        src="/projectimages/final-step-1.jpg"

        class="three"
      />
      <p class="caption">Orange and Green Sides</p>
      <p>
        Your cube should resemble the pictures above. The cube is nearly
        complete, however we have to reposition the yellow edges. As with the
        previous step, if you have a side completely solved (similar to green in
        the above picture), this side should be placed as the back side of the
        cube.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two very similar algorithms in order to complete the puzzle.
        The first algorithm is for a situation similar to the one shown in the
        pictures above. As seen, the yellow and blue edge needs to move to the
        right, aligning with the red side. In this situation, we will use the
        Final Right algorithm.
      </p>
      <p class="algo">
        Final Right Algorithm: F2, U’, R’, L, F2, R, L’, U’, F2
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Opposite situation, when the middle edge has to move to the left,
        the algorithm is:
      </p>
      <p class="algo">Final Right Algorithm: F2, U, R’, L, F2, R, L’, U, F2</p>
      <p>
        The only difference between these two is within the U turn. You turn the
        U layer the same side as the edge needs to go.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no side is completely finished after setting up the final step, still
        perform the above algorithm, however the positioning is inconsequential.
